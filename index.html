<h1>Welcome to the Flickr Tickler</h1>

<p>
  The Flickr Tickler is a unique way to view flickr pictures quickly and smoothly.
  Stay tuned for more great stuff!
</p>

<p>
  Using your keyboard (j to go down, k to go up - even across pages!), you can look at any group / set of flickr pictures you want. Group pools, personal photostreams, even tags!
</p>

<p>
  To get started, put any flickr url in this box and we'll take it from there. If you want to do a tag search, type one or more in the box instead. (Currently only users and groups are working)
</p>

<form action="/tickle" method="get">
  <div>
    <label for="url">URL:</label>
    <input type="text" name="url" id="url"/>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Start"/>
  </div>
</form>
